# Heraclitus Fragments

A repository for the fragments of Heraclitus. The fragments are randomly tweeted by [@HeraclitusBot](https://twitter.com/HeraclitusBot).

Each fragment is present in two files, a file `fragment-#.greek.txt` containing the original greek text, and a
file `fragment-#.english.txt` containing an english translation.

## How to contribute

You can contribute by completing or improving the translations. If a translation is already present, you can submit
your changes through a pull request. You can also just submit an issue if you spot an error that you can't fix. If a
translation file is not present, create it and name it as `fragment-#.english.txt`. You can also create translation
files for other languages, but the [@HeraclitusBot](https://twitter.com/HeraclitusBot) will not tweet them for the
moment.

You can also contribute by adding sources to this README.md file.
