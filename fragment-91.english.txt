It is not possible to enter twice in the same river,
nor touch twice a perishable substance in the same state;
because by its organicity and swiftness to change,
it spreads and again comes together,
or yet, it is not again or after,
but simultaneously that it assembles and disassembles,
that it comes and goes away;
and by this, its becoming doesnâ€™t turn into a being.
