Though this Word is true evermore, yet men
are as unable to understand it when they hear it for the first time as
before they have heard it at all. For, though all things come to pass in
accordance with this Word, men seem as if they had no experience of them,
when they make trial of words and deeds such as I set forth, dividing each
thing according to its kind and showing how it is what it is. But
other men know not what they are doing when awake, even as they forget
what they do in sleep.
